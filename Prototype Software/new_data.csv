,0,"I trust this message finds you well. I hope you don't mind me reaching out
to you directly regarding a matter that requires your attention.

I am writing to request a brief meeting with you tomorrow, Thursday, to
discuss the recent developments in my thesis research and the decisions
I've made concerning the data set and the path I intend to take. I believe
your insights will be invaluable in refining my approach.

I have been fortunate to secure an internship opportunity at Value, and my
first day is scheduled for Sunday. Unfortunately, this coincides with our
previously arranged meeting at 11:45, and I am unsure if I will be able to
attend on that day. Given the time sensitivity of my thesis work and the
impending internship commencement, I believe a face-to-face discussion
would be beneficial to ensure I am on the right track.

I understand the demands on your schedule and appreciate any time you can
spare for this meeting. If it suits you, I am available to pass by your
office tomorrow at a time that is convenient for you. Your guidance is
highly valuable to me, and I want to make the most of our collaboration.

Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards

Jon have access to it. You'll select it off the main reports menu. It will
say ""NGX Download report"". When you launch it, it will show the data on
screen like all other reports. There is a button at the bottom that says
""Export"". Clicking it will give you several selections. Choose the one that
says ""Save to NGX XML"". You can then save it as a file which can be mailed
to NGX. Let me know if there is anyone else who needs access. Thanks! -jay
